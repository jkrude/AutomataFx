Build to simulate different types of automata for educational purposes. 

Since it's fairly obvious to visualize automata, I thought it might be useful to play through different events and get an idea of the formal definitions. The current state is limited to the very core features of placing states and connecting them. Now as the foundation is implemented actual automata related features can be implemented.
